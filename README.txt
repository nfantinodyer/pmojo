This program is made to input the messages sent to patients from Practice Mojo into Softdent as those programs don't allow intercompatibility.
This is made for Oak Meadow Dental Center but can be used by everyone who has a practice mojo account as well as those who use softdent. 

Code length has been reduced greatly since the start, but there are still ways to improve efficiency of the program.

To run: open the file through python and type in the date in the format requested (MM/DD/YYYY) and press the start button. Make sure softdent is open into the patient search window and make sure chrome is closed.
