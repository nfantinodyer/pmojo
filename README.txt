This program is made to input the messages sent to patients from Practice Mojo into Softdent as those programs don't allow intercompatibility.
This is made for Oak Meadow Dental Center but can be used by everyone who has a practice mojo account as well as those who use softdent.
Very early addition and major ways to improve code length as well as better ways to get the information from practice mojo.

To run: open the file through python and type in the date in the format requested (MM/DD/YYYY) and press the start button. Make sure softdent is open into the patient search window and make sure chrome is closed.

Added a short version of the code that works the same.
